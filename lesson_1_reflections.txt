Diff pointed the exact locations where the changes were. 
Instead of scanning the whole file I had to only check where differences are.

I can always see the incremental changes that were made for different features.
This will help isolate any issues and fixing them fast.

In code the logical checkpoint is very important unlike text edits. 
Git helps in maintaining logical checkpoints for each version of file.

One logical change may split multiple files.
So it makes sense to have multiple files in a commit.

git log to find commits. then git diff to see differences.

I can always go back to a last working version.
Helps me in narrowing down the culprit.

Version control and collaboration.
